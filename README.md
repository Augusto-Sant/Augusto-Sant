### Hi there! 
I'm José, a Computer Science student from Brazil with a love for programming and solving problems. My main language is Python, but I also have experience in Java and PHP. I enjoy using Python for projects such as web scraping, web development, and data science.

I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself and grow as a programmer 💪💻🚀.
